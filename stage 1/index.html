                        <p>The web is basically the communication between the bunch of computers.It was invented in 1990 and it has upto '30 billion' pages.When a person goes to the web page like www.facebook.com,their computer sends the <em>HTTP request</em> to a <em>server</em>(Servers are computer except they are optimized to be sitting in a closet and hosting files rather than sitting on your desk browsing those files)
                            The server finds the requested HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer screen where a <em>web browser</em> illustrates the page and displays it on the screen.

                        <p>COMPUTERS ARE NEAR-OMNIPOTENT cauldrons of processing power, but they’re also stupid. They are the undisputed chess champions of the world, but they can’t understand a simple English conversation.why are the computer's stupid?
                            Computers are stupid because they describe instructions    
                            literally. This makes them very relentless since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
                            in a program.

                            A structured document is an electronic document where some method of embedded coding, such as mark-up, is used to give the whole, and parts, of the document various structural meanings according to a schema. A structured document whose mark-up doesn't break the schema and is designed to conform to and which obeys the syntax rules of its mark-up language is "well-formed".The most widely used markup language, in all its evolving forms, is HTML

                            The HTML div tag is used for defining a section of your document. With the div tag, we can group large sections of HTML elements together and format them with CSS.we use
                            &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                            to create an invisible box around the document.
                            The difference between the div tag and the span tag is that the div tag is used with block-level elements whilst the span tag is used with inline elements.
                            The Tree-like structure comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on
                            In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on
